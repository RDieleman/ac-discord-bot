- Bot is going to be public, so need way to verify guild when bot is added to guild

#Database
  - how are guilds saved?
    Single or multiple databases?
  - saving the trialend date?
  - are events deleted after a while?
    if so, prob better to avoid the normalization
  - if using normalization probably best to use stored procedures
  - user_id in Event table should be member_id?
  - active value seems weird to save in db?
  - Event table needs guild id value if using a single database for all guilds
